    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>
    I found my passion as a lifelong learner and problem solver and became a software engineer. I am seeking opportunities where the practices of Software Craftsmanship, Clean Code and Clean Architecture are practiced. I favor functional abstractions in code design—using React and Redux for web views—and bounded context microservice architecture for ease of maintainability and code reuse.</p>
